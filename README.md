JavaScript Calculator
This project is a simple calculator completed as the final project of the foundations course on the Odin Project. The calculator is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the UI is composed of a small display that shows the number input by the user as well as the current calculation along with a grid of buttons the user can press. The calculator allows the user to enter numbers and perform either addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on them. In addition, it also supports the use of negative and decimal values as well as allowing the user to square values. Should the user input the wrong number by accident, they can use the clear button to delete a single digit at a time or they can click the all-clear button to start a fresh calculation.
